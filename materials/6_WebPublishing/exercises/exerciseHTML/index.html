            EXERCISE 1 1
            
            Start creating your project website or personal website.

            You find here some suggestion to work on this webpage.
            Do not forget to use the references mentioned above or simply to google what you are looking for. For example, you can search for "list in HTML"

            To open this page in the browser:
            - in oXygen, click on the icon of the document in the world, the fifth left;
            - or go in the folder and double click the file 'index.html', which will open in the browser.

            Each time you modify the text or one of the elements, refresh the page in the browser.

            1. Change the title of the page, in the header.

            2. In the body, add titles of different levels: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.
            
            3. Use the separator <hr /> (horizontal line) to organize your page.

            4. Insert a list. This is an example:

            <ul><li>première chose</li><li>deuxième chose</li><li>etc.</li></ul> 
            If you use the tag <ol> instead of <ul>, what does it change?

            5. After the separator, insert an image. You can use one of the images in the folder.
            To insert an image, use <img src="bataille.jpg" alt="Bataille" />.
            The attribute 'src' indicates the path of the image. The attribute 'alt' indicates the alternative text (if the browser can't load the image).

            6. Use the elements <em> and <blockquote> to format parts of the text.
            
            7. Add a link towards a webpage using the element <a> (look at how it is used in the example text already present).

    <!-- 
            EXERCISE 2
            
            1. Create a new HTML page. To do it, copy this HTML file and rename it 'about.html'.

            2. Change the content, to briefly present your website (it is the 'About' page!).

            3. Add a paragraph, with the element <p>. Inside it, create a link to the other page with the element <a>; the attribute 'href' should have the path to the file index.html: if they are in the same folder, this is <a href="index.html">.
